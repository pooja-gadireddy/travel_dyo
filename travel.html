		<h1>My Dream Vacation Spot: Canada!</h1>
		<hr>
		  <img src="travel_image1.jpg" width="250" height="166" alt=""><strong><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 19pt; color:#286D84">Banff National Park: </span></strong> Banff National Park has a long and celebrated history as one of the world’s premier mountain destinations. Throughout centuries of indigenous peoples' habitation, the establishment of a National Park in 1885, and today’s modern, world class destination: the landscape of Banff National Park has long inspired people with its natural beauty and grandeur. What makes Banff National Park so special is its easy access and close proximity to the vast unspoiled wilderness of the Canadian Rockies. The park spans 6,641 square kilometers (2,564 square miles) of mountainous terrain, packed with spectacularly scenic valleys, peaks, glaciers, forests, meadows and rivers. It is home to black and grizzly bears, wolverines, elk, deer, bighorn sheep, bald eagles and many other mammal and bird species. Big on tourism and nature, Banff National Park is a beautiful place for me to visit and just feel serene as the water moves. I hope to take a ride in the Banff Gondola and go for a hike.

			<strong><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 19pt; color:#286D84">Butchart Gardens: </span></strong> The Butchart Gardens is a group of floral display gardens in Brentwood Bay, British Columbia, Canada, located near Victoria on Vancouver Island. The gardens receive over a million visitors each year. The gardens have been designated a National Historic Site of Canada. In 1982 the Butchart Gardens was used as the inspiration for the Canadian pavilion at Epcot in Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. Additionally, there are a total of six gardens for visitors to tour. At the entrance visitors will find the original Sunken Garden, progressing on to find the Rose Garden, Japanese Garden, Italian Garden and the Mediterranean Garden. As a big nature lover, when the weather is nice, these gardens will be a nice place to take pictures and just admire the beauty and history behind the gardens.

			<strong><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 19pt; color:#286D84">CN Tower: </span></strong> The CN Tower is a 553.3 m-high concrete communications and observation tower located in the downtown core of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Built on the former Railway Lands, it was completed in 1976. Its name "CN" originally referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. At this tower, you can indulge in the world’s highest ‘hands-free’ walk and get a birds eye view of downtown Toronto, all of which I hope to partake in. I have always been a sucker for city life, especially in the nighttime, and Toronto would be perfect for this.

As a major foodie, Canada is a place with a vast variety of foods and dishes. Some of their proudest or most native dishes include Poutine, maple syrup, and bannock. </p>

      <p><img src="travel_image3.jpg" width="250" height="166" alt=""/><strong><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 19pt; color:#286D84">History: </span></strong>Canada is the second largest country in the world, occupying roughly the northern two-fifths of the continent of North America. Canada is made up of ten provinces and three territories; the capital city is Ottawa, but you might also be familiar with other major cities like Vancouver, Toronto and the French-speaking Québec and Montréal. Canada is bilingual, with English and French being the two official languages, but most people speak English at home. You might hear some common Canadian slang such as loonie (a dollar coin), chinook (a warm wind that comes over the mountain in mid-winter) and Hog Town (nickname for Toronto).</p>
